### What is it?

This capstone project represents the culmination of the Master of Science in Electrical Engineering with specialization in Wireless Communication program at National University. This project focused on the research and development of a wireless sensor network for use in the medical field pertaining to out-patient monitoring. The developed system's first deployment consisted of four wireless biometric devices transmitting communications over a Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). The observed biometric data was obtained by a combination of sampling, reading analog and digital voltage values, and conversions performed by each deviceâ€™s processor, then transmitted to a centralized LoRaWAN Gateway, which was then parsed and forwarded to a network server via TCP/IP Stack to be stored and displayed by hosted services and applications; forming a lightweight and functional management platform. The project team developed and successfully tested the proposed LoRaware system throughout the course of a three-month duration.

The sensor sets are portable and wrist-wearable and include sensors for biometric measurements, a ESP32 MCU, a Lithium Polymer battery, LoRa RF Modulation chipset and external antenna for data transmissions. All components fit in a low-profile enclosure.
